# Templated meta-predicates for Prolog

This library provides a templating system to ease the development of meta-predicates and a handful of basic meta-predicates based on this system.

Templating is implemented by the predicate, replace/3, which takes a template term and substitutes arguments for placeholders. Placeholder terms are of the form $K and are replaced by the Kth argument. In SWI Prolog, arguments may be provided as a dict.

For example:
```prolog
?- replace(foo($1, $2), [bar, baz($1)], X).
X = foo(bar, baz(bar)).
```

The rest of the library is dedicated to meta-predicates that take advantage of templates. The most basic is call_tmpl/2 which takes a template and arguments and calls the goal resulting from the instantiation of the template. The most useful may be for/2, which maps a template goal over a list.

For example, to assert that a collection of lists all have length 2:
```prolog
?- for([X,Y,Z], length($1, 2)).
X = [_A, _B],
Y = [_C, _D],
Z = [_E, _F].
```

Variables in the template are replaced for each call. Variables and placeholders can be escaped from replacement with \/1.

For example, to assert that a collection of terms all have the same functor:
```prolog
?- for([foo, foo(_), foo(_,_)], functor($1,\F,_)).
F = foo.
```

Like for/2, many of the meta-predicates loop over collections. In addition to lists, all looping predicates accept dicts (in SWI Prolog) and goals which, when called with an additional variable argument, bind that argument to a list (or dict). The included predicates range/3 and range/4 work with this feature to simplify looping over lists of ordered numbers.


## Why

I've wanted this implementation of map/2 for a while, so I took a free weekend to implement it. The basic infrastructure was generally useful, so I ran with it.

My primary motivation for map/2 was to replace helper predicates that loop over lists with anonymous predicates, and SWI's maplist/2+ wasn't expressive enough to do that.


## API

### Templating

#### replace(+Template, +Arguments, -Term) is det
Term is like Template except all subterms of the form $K in Template are replaced by the Kth term in Arguments. In SWI Prolog, Arguments may be a dict. If K is not an index or key of Arguments, the term is not replaced. Arguments my also include $K terms which are replaced recursively. Variables are replaced by new ones. To prevent a replacement, escape the term with \/1.

### Calling

#### call_tmpl(:Template, +Arguments) is nondet
Substitutes Arguments into Template with replace/3 and calls the result.

#### once_tmpl(:Template, +Arguments) is semidet
Substitutes Arguments into Template with replace/3 and calls the result once, cutting any leftover choice-points.

#### ignore_tmpl(:Template, +Arguments) is det
Substitutes Arguments into Template with replace/3 and calls the result once, cutting any leftover choice-points and succeeding regardless of whether the subgoal succeeds.

### Looping

#### for(+Iter, :Template)
Sugar for map([Iter], Template).

#### map(+Iters, :Template)
Maps the Template goal over the Iters. Terms of the form $N in the Template are replaced by the value of the Nth iterable.

Analogous to SWI Prolog's maplist.

For example:
```prolog
?- map([X, [1,2,3], [4,5,6]], $1 is $2 + $3).
X = [5, 7, 9].
```

#### fold(-V, +V0, +Iters, :Template)
Folds some Iters into a single value with a Template goal. In the Template,$1 refers to the next value of the accumulator, $2 refers to the current value of the accumulator, and $N refers to the current value of the (N-2)th list. V0 is the initial value of the accumulator and V is its final value.

Analogous to SWI Prolog's foldl.

For example:
```prolog
compute the sum of the pairwise product of two lists.
i.e. V is 1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6.
?- fold(V, 0, [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], $1 is $2 + $3 * $4).
V = 32.
```

#### scan(-Vs, +V0, +Iters, :Template)
Like fold/4, but record intermediate results.

Analogous to SWI Prolog's scanl.

For example:
```prolog
?- scan(Vs, 0, [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], $1 is $2 + $3 * $4).
Vs = [0, 4, 14, 32].
```

#### foldp(:Template, -Folded, +Identity, +Tree)
Folded is the partial reduction of Tree, meaning that the innermost lists of Tree are reduced according to the Template. In Template, $1 is refers to the next value of the accumulator, $2 refers to the current value of the accumulator, and $3 refers to the value being brought into the fold. Identity is the initial value of the accumulator for all reductions.

For example:
```prolog
?- P = ($1 is $2 + $3),
	V0 = [[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9]]],
	foldp(V1, 0, V0, P),
	foldp(V2, 0, V1, P),
	foldp(V3, 0, V2, P).

V1 = [[6, 15], [24]],  % [1,2,3] -> 6. [4,5,6] -> 15. [7,8,9] -> 24.
V2 = [21, 24],         % [6,15] -> 21. [24] -> 24.
V3 = 45.               % [21,24] -> 45.
```

foldp/4 is easier to read than fold/4 for single list folds:
```prolog
?- foldp(V, 0, [1,2,3,4,5], $1 is $2 + $3).
V = 15.
```

#### mapp(-Mapped, +Tree, :Template)
Mapped is the result of mapping the leaf nodes of a Tree according to the Template. In the Template, $1 refers to the mapped node, and $2 refers to the original Node.

For example:
```prolog
?- mapp(M, [[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]],[[7,8,9]]], $1 is $2 + 1).
M = [[[2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]], [[8, 9, 10]]].
```

mapp/3 is easier to read than map/2 for single list maps:
```prolog
?- mapp(M, [1,2,3,4,5], $1 is $2 + 1).
M is [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
```

### Iterables

#### iterable(?Iter, ?H, ?T) is semidet
Iter is an iterable with the head H and tail T. If Iter has only one element, T must be [].

The following are valid iterables:
- Lists are iterables over their elements. The empty list is not an iterable.
- Dicts in SWI Prolog are iterables over key-value pairs.
- Any term which can be called with an additional variable argument that is to be unified to a list containing the iterable's elements.

Custom iterators should be implemented with freeze/2 as lazy lists. For example, consider this possible implementation for range/3:
```
range(A, Z, [A|T]) :-
    A < Z, !,
    freeze(T, (
        B is A + 1,
        range(B, Z, T)
    )).
range(_, _, []).
```

#### iterables(?Iters, ?Heads, ?Tails) is semidet
Iters is a collection of 0 or more iterables.
Heads is a list of their heads.
Tails is a list of their tails.

#### range(+A, +Z, -Range)
Range is the list of numbers on the interval [A,Z) with a stride of ±1.
A may be less than or greater than Z.
Range is a lazy list, so large ranges are OK in deterministic settings.
This predicate can be used with iterable/3.

#### range(+A, +Z, +S, -Range)
Range is the list of numbers on the interval [A,Z) with a stride of S.
% If Z is less than A, S must be negative, otherwise S must be positive.
Range is a lazy list, so large ranges are OK in deterministic settings.
This predicate can be used with iterable/3.
